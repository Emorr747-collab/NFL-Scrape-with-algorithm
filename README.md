NFL Data Scrape

The files uploaded were for a little bored project of scoring each Skill position player (QB,WR,RB, & TE) to see which value can you find the bang for your buck at each position and to see where you can find the most value in each Round.

Still tweaking the algorhtim on what needs to be weighted more so the score is more accurate along with trying to weigh how many QBs come from said college. I.e. since Big Ben is the only QB drafted from Miami (OH), my data likes to show that Miami(OH) is the school to draft QBs from, which isn't the case.

But this the main stuff is there as far as the scrape. Feel free to use it, have fun. Provide feedbacl
